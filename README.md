# BotBox Interactive Story
## Description
This interactive 2D animation, *BotBox Interactive Story*, was created in Adobe Animate.  
It is a short branching story inspired by a Newgrounds project:  
[https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/842186](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/842186)

The player makes decisions to advance to the next scene or restart if they fail.  
I used labeled frames, sounds, and coding in Animateâ€™s Canvas/ActionScript to control branching logic.  
Button events and sound effects provide feedback, while the Game Over sequence loops back to the beginning.  
This demonstrates my ability to combine **visual design, animation, and coding** into one interactive experience.
